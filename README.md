testing github

I use this github repository for learning golang, and sharing files between my laptop and main pc :)

If you like any of the stuff in here feel free to use it, it is mostly just small assignments and some project euler problems.

Im using this course to learn Go and i highly recommend it, most of the code here is related to this course.
